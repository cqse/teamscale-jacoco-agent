We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/):

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

- [feature] if no `teamscale-commit`, `teamscale-git-properties-jar` or `teamscale-commit-manifest-jar` is configured,
  all loaded Jar/War/Ear/... files that contain profiled code are checked for a `git.properties` file. This allows auto-detecting a
  `git.properties` file without any additional configuration. 

# 15.1.1
- [documentation] Configuration for SAP NetWeaver Java (>= 7.50) is now documented

# 15.1.0

  validation will be disabled from this version on

# 14.0.0
- [fix] Reduced memory requirements for generating testwise coverage.
- [breaking change] When using the `convert` tool in `--testwise-coverage` mode the new `--split-after 5000` option will
  break up testwise coverage files automatically after the specified number of tests written. This ensures that generated 
  reports are small enough to be uploaded to Teamscale. Default is `5000`. The given output file will now be appended 
  suffixed `-1`, `-2` etc.. If the specified output file is named `testwise_coverage.json` the actually written file 
  will be called `testwise_coverage-1.json` for the first 5000 tests. For uploading multiple files use an upload session.

# 13.0.0
- [feature] added `dump-on-exit` option
