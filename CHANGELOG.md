# 29.1.2
- [fix] _teamscale-maven-plugin_: Partition was not correctly provided to the impacted test engine

- [fix] Fixed the prefix extraction pattern and the partition pattern for Artifactory in the agent's documentation
- [fix/breaking change] _teamscale-client_, _teamscale-gradle-plugin_, _teamscale-maven-plugin_, _teamscale-jacoco-agent_: Teamscale 8.0 introduced the concept of execution units. To distinguish them from normal, singular test executions, the `-test-exection-` and `-execution-unit-` uniform path prefixes were introduced. This broke gradle and maven test runner plugins because the actual test paths and Teamscale's uniform paths did not match anymore. To prevent this, `testName` is now exposed by the teamscale client and used by the plugins which corresponds to the uniform path without the prefixes. **If you're using the client, or listen to the `/testrun/start` API from the Teamscale JaCoCo agent, this is a breaking change.** You now need to use `testName` in your runner, not the `uniformPath`.

# 28.0.0
- [breaking change] removed support for JavaWS
- [fix] Fixed git.properties detection when directories are on the classpath

# 27.0.2
- [fix] Updated dependencies (Fixes #225, CVE-2022-42889)

# 27.0.1

# 26.0.2

- [fix] Testwise coverage conversion was slow when many .exec files are included.

# 26.0.1

- [fix] The agent could not be started with the `debug=true` command line option

# 26.0.0

- [fix] _impacted-test-engine_: Handle tests with trailing whitespaces correctly
- [breaking] _impacted-test-engine_: Now requires Teamscale 8.0 as minimum version

# 25.0.0

 - [breaking] Find git.properties files recursively in folders, all types of archive files (jar, war, ear, aar, ...) and arbitrary depth. This was only possible for nested jar and war files and up to nesting depth 1. If you'd like to disable recursive search, e.g. due to performance issues, please use `search-git-properties-recursively=false`.  
  Note: This is not actually a breaking change but if you profile large projects and don't use the multi-project upload, you might want to disable recursive search.

# 24.1.1

- [fix] Maven plugin for TIA: sometimes the agent was not attached to a Spring Boot application during integration tests

# 24.1.0

  configuration file. In debug mode logs are written to console and a configurable directory. For more details, see
  [here](agent/README.md#general-options).
- [breaking change] Artifactory uploader: use of new default upload schema for easy integration with Teamscale. To keep the old behavior add the `artifactory-legacy-path=true` option. For more details see 
  [here](agent/README.md#options-for-the-artifactory-upload).

  plugin compatible with `dependencyResolutionManagement`)
- [breaking change] _teamscale-gradle-plugin_: The `TestImpacted` task now collects testwise coverage by default even
  without the `--impacted` option being set. Can be disabled programmatically with `collectTestwiseCoverage = false`.

  directory)
- [feature] if no `teamscale-commit`, `teamscale-git-properties-jar` or `teamscale-commit-manifest-jar` is configured,
  all loaded Jar/War/Ear/... files that contain profiled code are checked for a `git.properties` file. This allows
  auto-detecting a
  `git.properties` file without any additional configuration.

# 14.0.0

- [fix] Reduced memory requirements for generating testwise coverage.
- [breaking change] When using the `convert` tool in `--testwise-coverage` mode the new `--split-after 5000` option will
  break up testwise coverage files automatically after the specified number of tests written. This ensures that
  generated reports are small enough to be uploaded to Teamscale. Default is `5000`. The given output file will now be
  appended suffixed `-1`, `-2` etc.. If the specified output file is named `testwise_coverage.json` the actually written
  file will be called `testwise_coverage-1.json` for the first 5000 tests. For uploading multiple files use an upload
  session.
