Feature: Calculator
  As a user
  I want to use a calculator to add numbers
  So that I don't need to add myself

  Scenario Outline: Add two numbers 0 & 0
    Given I have a calculator
    When I add 0 and 0
    Then the result should be 0

  Scenario Outline: Add two numbers <num1> & <num2>
    Given I have a calculator
    When I add <num1> and <num2>
    Then the result should be <total>

  Examples:
    | num1 | num2 | total |
    | -2 | 3 | 1 |
    | 10 | 15 | 25 |
    | 99 | -99 | 0 |
    | -1 | -10 | -11 |
